Open source, free to modify

made by "linus Linux"
many OS's utilize the Linix Kernal, which is based on the Unix Kernal

generally inside it is "package manager" (download), int system (running?) GNU tools, libraries, documentation, ect.
available as source code, binaries, ect. Some might have propiatary code, but...

some major distributions are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Redhat...

Made by Linus Torvalds made the Kernal
And, effect "Linux is an interface between hardware and software"
When Linus was in school, they where useing MINIX.
He kept asking for some improvments (and others), but the developer Andrew Tanuabam.
Linus Torvalds made the kernel, but had no programs. Stalman had programs but no OS. Both where usless on their own... but combined became Linux
Linus said "are you without a nice project and dying to cut your teeth on an OS you can try to modify your needs? this post might just be for you!"
