1.0: 1985, interface manager. Oddly, it's not supported...

Windows 2000: introduced NTFS 3.0, encrypting file system, basic and dynamic disc storage

Windows XP: one of the classic older ones, it was primarily just improved UI and extra hardware support, plus more multimedia stuff. Not sure what makes it well known...

Windows VISTA: released in 2007, basicly a redesing of must subsytems and updated GUI

 Windows 8: Optimizeing for touch and such

Windows 8.1: released in 2013, ability to snap up to 4 apps, and, interestingly, bing-based unified search system was added, so, it's younger than I thought... (granted, not all 8.1 versions had it)
