RAID

Redundant Array; Independant Disck
it uses multiple discks as one disck, to allow the storing of data redundantly

it is used to make data more redundant

unlike JBOD (Just a bunch of discks). Acording to the computer, a RAID will look like one hardrive, whereas JBODS are multiple hardrives, and seen that way by the computer.

Unlike JBOD, RAID makes data more redundant

Parts:
The controller, which is what makes the computer see it as 1 volume, and manages the backup

2 main types; Hardware, and Software. Hardware ones are more reliable
an example is a "PERC" card
Software ones are based on programs, meaning no hardware. It's more configurable and easy to use. But it relies on the CPU/ RAM
Firmware based RAID is built into most BIOS/ UEFI systems, operating on vender-level scale. You may need specific drivers, but

There are many types and features

some terms:

Data Striping:
can read in parallel, stores every other piece of information, no fault tolerance

Mirrioring: stores a copy of all information on 2 drives, this means no extra space, but perfect copy

Parity: you loose more like 1/3 of all the capacity. Instead of duplicating data, it uses a "parity block" to allow recreation of lost data
3 Main categories:
Standard-
- Raid 0: uses Striping to just split the data
- Dead Standard:(outdated)
	Raid 2: bit-level striping...
	Raid 3: used striping and parity
	Raid 4: same
Raid 5: uses block-level striping with parity blocks. It has better performance, if you loose 1 hardrive, the data is retrievable
Non-Standard-
Hybrid-
