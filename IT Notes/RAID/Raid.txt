RAID

Redundant Array; Independant Disck
it uses multiple discks as one disck, to allow the storing of data redundantly

it is used to make data more redundant

unlike JBOD (Just a bunch of discks). Acording to the computer, a RAID will look like one hardrive, whereas JBODS are multiple hardrives, and seen that way by the computer.

Unlike JBOD, RAID makes data more redundant

Parts:
The controller, which is what makes the computer see it as 1 volume, and manages the backup

2 main types; Hardware, and Software. Hardware ones are more reliable
an example is a "PERC" card
Software ones are based on programs.

There are many types and featuressome terms:
Data Striping:
can read in parallel, stores every other piece of information, no fault tolerance
Mirrioring: stores a copy of all information on 2 drives, this means no extra space, but perfect copy
