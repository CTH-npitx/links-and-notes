OSI
	open systems interconnection

TCP/ IP
	Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

Five-Layer Model


7 layers of OSI
= Upper Layer: deal with application issues and implemented in software
- lower layers:hardware

transport ("heart" of it)

Layers are:

Upper: 
	Application
		the interface (web browser)
	Presentation
		How it's being presented (displayed on screen)
	Session
		Establishing, Maintaining, and forming the connection
middle:
	Transport
		how it travels (protocols)
			TCP
				Transmission Control Protocol
				Guranteed
			UDP
				User Datagram Protocol
				Gets There
		Ip adresses
lower
	Network
		IP addresses
		packets (creating and routing)
	Data Link
		organizing bits of data into "frames", which helps to form the packets
		the mac address
	Physical
		all the physical components (routers, switches, cables, antennas, repeater, modem)




TCP/IP
	4 layers
		
	Application
		The program
	Transport
		Make sure data is sent via TCP/UDP
	Network/ Internet
		networking layer
	Network Access
		Physical Connections
