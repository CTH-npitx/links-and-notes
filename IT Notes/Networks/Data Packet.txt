max size ~16 bit intiger limit

it breaks it down, and part of it has a "header", so that it's arrival can be confirmed
the header is ~16 bits, the rest is the "payload".

an "IP packet" just means it's a "packet with IP protocol (#RAS Syndrome)". Sometimes this might include size, but generally they always do. Sometimes will allow fragmentation

Datagram is another word.
