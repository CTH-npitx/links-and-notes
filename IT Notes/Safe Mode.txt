Safe mode disables every third party software, leaveing just the base windows drivers
very good to determine if the issue is windows-based, or third party software based. Or hardware.

you can tell you are in safe mode if there is no background, it says safemode in the corners, the very top has the windows build version

there are many ways to do it:
	one of the simplest ways is to use "ms config", also known as System Configuration
		look at the OS (this is also how you can change default OS's. Hit the check box labled "safe mode")
