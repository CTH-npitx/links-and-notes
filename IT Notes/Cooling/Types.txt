Active: uses mechanical means

2 main ways
	air-based, useing fans
	liquid based
air-based can be noisy, but won't leak. Liquid cooling uses a liquid (often water). It passes through the components, then goes to a radiator. Much more efficient, quieter, and can reach lower temps (especially if you use a cooler medium, lique LN2, as liquid nitrogen is cold). But if it leaks...

now, there is a phase change cooling. Can reach sub-ambient tempatures, works via evaporative cooling and condensation. However, it's not as simple
