Active: uses mechanical means

2 main ways
	air-based, useing fans
	liquid based
air-based can be noisy, but won't leak. Liquid cooling uses a liquid (often water). It passes through the components, then goes to a radiator. Much more efficient, quieter, and can reach lower temps (especially if you use a cooler medium, lique LN2, as liquid nitrogen is cold). But if it leaks...

now, there is a phase change cooling. Can reach sub-ambient tempatures, works via evaporative cooling and condensation. However, it's not as simple

thermoelectric: uses the peltier effect to create a tempature differential. But, it's not always effective at dissipating heat

passive cooling: systems that don't require power
heatsinks: devices with a high surface area, and thermal conductivity. Uses convection and such
	dependant on airflow, so if enclosed... not very good

thermal pads and thermal paste: they fill in the small imperfections to allow better heat conduction

benifits of effective cooling: better performance, longevity

cable management will help

in bios, you can adjust speed, adjust curve...ect.
