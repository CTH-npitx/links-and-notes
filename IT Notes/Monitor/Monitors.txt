CRT: cathode ray tube, 
	640x480
	800x600
	1024x768
got to
used "VGA" cables for standard def

CRT's don't have a "fixed native resoloution"
had a higher refresh rate of 75+ hertz, "flicker free"

16:9 is normal aspect ratio, good for "cinematic and immersive"
2010's 4K, ~8 million pixels

in the "todays", OLED (organic LED), very good contrast, ability to do "perfect" black by turning off the pixel

lots of pages, graphic designs, ect. Higher resoloution is better.

For 4K videos, more resoloution = better, 4K optimal. But more graphics power

many monitors use >60 hertz refresh, gameing monitors often go up to 200+

Response time is how long it takes for the pixels to change color, smaller=better

screen (the plastic between you and the lights)
IPS- known for excellent color reproduction, and wide view angle. Good for graphic design, photo editing, other color sensitive work
VA- high contrast ratio, good view angle
TN: fast response times, worse viewing angle, worse color

_______________________________
LCD: like a filter. There is a light source, and a "LCD" filter that alters the orientation of the Liquid Crystal
	okay energy efficiency
LED: uses LED (Light emmiting diode), distributed along the edges, or fully along the back (fully backlit), allowing altering
		okay energy
OLED: each pixel is it's own organic light source. So each pixel can be different, and it can be "true black", as you can have it off.
	most efficient

specific technology:

HDR:High Dynamic Range
	improve the quality and contrast of older formats. Dynamic range describes the range, HDR makes the contrast
wether it can reach 200 knits, or 2000 knits (very dark, blinding), still limited by signal. It scales ranges so old formats which don't have the range. HDR just has steps to edit it, to scale the light
