wrong refresh rate, can cause "no signal", as it has no valid input

if using tv, might need to use "overscan" or "underscan", 

aspect ratio can be messed up using portrait mode

in game settings can fix using the wrong monitor, if not  

win + i 
	opens settings

when it defaults to duplicate, change it ( win + p, or settings)
	win + p
		loads project menue

monitor(s) constantly flickering
	check cables

wone monitor off, check cables, settings, ect.

mismatched colors:
	get same monitor
	color profile might allow enough adjustments to fix it
		or display calabriation

if doing 3 monitors:
	basically the same
can only duplicate 2 (it will extend to 1, then duplicate one of those 2 monitors to the other)

check drivers and such

(back to "multi-monitor"):
games keep minimizing
	could be you clicking another monitor

apps and tabs kepp getting shuffled
	it's a display setting

visual distortions or artifacting: same as normal artifacting/ distortin, but perhaps shortening cable

display hub/ docking station: there might be some limitations to the signals and such.
	some cap refresh rates for 8K or 4K with more than 2 screens

monitor suddenly malfunctions:
	updates, drivers, cables...
win + ctrl + shift + b
	reset graphics driver

images don't align:
	misaligned monitor size or resolution
