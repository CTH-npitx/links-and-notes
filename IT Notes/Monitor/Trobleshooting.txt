no drivers, built in settings, ect.
typically it will display a box if it works.

IPS glow: mostly just minimization, distance, bright light, ect. Losening the screen might help
	more a material constrait

backlight bleed is when the light "bleeds" around the edges
	more a design flaw than anything. Soloution? don't cheap out
	light obstructing tabe can help

Blurry Display: it started with the CRT's, and it's not going anywhere
	try looking into software, check drivers. Afterwards, check if plugging in a working one fixes it.
	alternate ports
	check cables
	graphics card

	windows key + shift + b
		to restart graphics drivers


bad pixels: a dead pixel, if a few, it's just annoying. If enough though...
	some programs claim to be able to fix it, they work via something cauld "box flashing"
	if caused by the liquid(crystal), try gently pushing, that can redistribute the liquid

clouding: if you mishandle it, the LCD panels can get

burn in: primarily an issue with CRT's, but still an issue. If the damage is minor, then it's just the image lingering short term, but if kept too long, it will be permanent.
	if you have ghosting, turn off the monitor short term
once it's become more major, you can try flashing through every color in the spectrum, or pure white. That can mitigate it
