Inkjet: sprays dots of ink onto the paper.
	Can do color, black and white, ect. It's just ink.
Laser: use a laser to make an electric picture on a heat. They are fast and produce crisp text. They are cheaper overtime, but they are more expensive upfront. They are all larger, but the color ones are even larger and more expensive
Dot Matrix: they had a bunch pins that hit a ribbon, and that transferred the ink. But they are loud and low-quality, however they can make more than one at once (especially with carbon paper). They are nowadays mostly just for carbon copies and receipts
Thermal Transfer Printers: they just burn it in, the quality may fade (literally fade over time), and requires a special paper. Fast and quiet.
Dye-Sublimation Printers: use heat to transfer dye onto special papper or other materials like fabric or plastic. They are often used for shirts. Expensive ink and spacer, long last
3D printing: uses a filament to build stuff. Can be slow, some filiments are expensive, sometimes multiple filiments
All in one printers: they combine multiple functions, including printing, copying, scanning, and faxing. They provide conviencence, but are sometimes "jack of all trades, master of none"
Large Format Printers: for larger pieces of paper, they have high detail, oversized, are large
