output

connected via buses (part of chipset?)

runs on a cycle (Fetch -> Decode -> Execute)
	it fetches the data, decodes the instructures/ info, and then executes it


control unit executes machine code (assembly). Syncronyzes everything to the clockspeed

bus types, circuit on motherboard. connects all components to CPU/ RAM
Adress Bus: transfers memory addresses, operate unidirectionally
data bus: transfer data
combine them, and you have the system bus

control bus, bi-directional

EPROM: erasable programable read only memory


Von Neumann architecture relies on the stored program concept: 
Machine code instructions are fetched and executed serially by a processor that can perform arithmetic 
and logic operations. 
there are two requirments. First, Two requirements for the stored program concept:
A program must be resident in the memory to be executed, and the instructions must be fetched from the memory one at a time, decoded and 
executed by the processor. 

other key features:
the same data bus is used for both instructions and data. It has a bidirectional flow.
a single address bus is used for the unidirectional transmission of address locations from CPU to memory/ IO
same word length is used for all memory, whether it holds data or instructions
