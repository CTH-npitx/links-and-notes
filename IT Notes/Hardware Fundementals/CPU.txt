output

connected via buses (part of chipset?)

runs on a cycle (Fetch -> Decode -> Execute)
	it fetches the data, decodes the instructures/ info, and then executes it


control unit executes machine code (assembly). Syncronyzes everything to the clockspeed

bus types, circuit on motherboard. connects all components to CPU/ RAM
Adress Bus: transfers memory addresses, operate unidirectionally
data bus: transfer data
combine them, and you have the system bus

control bus, bi-directional
