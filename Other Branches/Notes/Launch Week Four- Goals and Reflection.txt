Getting to be able to go to college. Also will probally try to:
1. Going to the parties at least once
2. Maybe try that DnD thing
3. Knights of the Lunch Table? Not sure.

Ideas:
1. Stuff related more to sciences, specificly physics
2. Classes looking into math, especially above geometry (Calculaus, Linear Algebra, ect.)
3. Classes into AI and Machine Learning
4. More (as I think of it)
