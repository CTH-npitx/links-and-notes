fixing corrupted BIOS is similar to fixing OS, only more dangerous
most effective is "warranty"
if you have a gigabyte motherboard, there is a backup BIOS. If the main one is corrupted, you use the backup. If possible, it will use itself as a reference to fix the code. If it doesn't auto-happen, 
power-off
press and hold reset button
third method is to use a paper clip to short pins one and 6 (on the "m-BIOS", or "main Bios")
next:
remove the discreet Graphics card
if your CPU doesn't have integrated graphics, well... if you remove the discreet card and there is no integrated, well, no graphics!
Reset the BIOS
remove CMOS, (assuming if you can boot into BIOS), reset the jumper. There may be a "restore factory settings" or "load setup defaults"
can brick stuff, cause issues. BIOS is DANGEROUS
Use jumper (Old motherboards)
