fixing corrupted BIOS is similar to fixing OS, only more dangerous
most effective is "warranty"
if you have a gigabyte motherboard, there is a backup BIOS. If the main one is corrupted, you use the backup. If possible, it will use itself as a reference to fix the code. If it doesn't auto-happen, 
power-off
press and hold reset button
third method is to use a paper clip to short pins one and 6 (on the "m-BIOS", or "main Bios")
next:
remove the discreet Graphics card
if your CPU doesn't have integrated graphics, well... if you remove the discreet card and there is no integrated, well, no graphics!
