It is important to know the contents of a file before reading it.
Otherwise the output may not be what you expect.
For text files, it will be easy to read and process.
For other types of files it will be substantially more difficult.
Be sure to enclose your File read code in a Try-Catch construct to prevent runtime errors.

using the File.ReadAllText or File.ReadAllLines vs the Stream options will take some practice to determine when to use them.
Good luck and remember to COMMENT YOUR CODE!
