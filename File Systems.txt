FAT 32 is common due to compatibility

NTFS is "FAT 64"
	It's the most recent, modern one
Supports permissions and and encryptions
File size limit of 16 exabytes
Journaling (making periodical updates of files. This system allows it to "restore" to a point. So if an update breaks windows, it can return to a specific point)
windows 3.1 was the first with it (1993), first to require it was windows 8

exFat: extended file allocation
	closer to being truly FAT-64, as it's based on the same technology, but with minor modifications. Read right on mac OS and other OS. EVEN WINDOWS! It has the benifits of four

Linux uses "ext, ext2, ext3, ext4"
no native windows or mac support. Has journaling (as of 2001, ext3). As of 2008, ext4 is default. as of 2025, most recent is ext4
file size of 166 terabites, volume of 1 exabyte...
